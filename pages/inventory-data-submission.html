<h3>What is E-Gov Integrated Data Collection?</h3>

<p>OMB seeks to streamline agency reporting requirements to improve meaningful use of reported data by OMB and agencies for IT strategic decision-making.</p>

<p>E-Gov Integrated Data Collection (IDC) is a consolidated approach to reporting requirements related to OMB's Office of E-Government and IT, the Federal CIO, and the Federal IT management community. Although established through PortfolioStat 2013, the scope of IDC and this MAX page goes beyond PortfolioStat.</p>
