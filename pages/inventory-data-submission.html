<h3>What is E-Gov Integrated Data Collection?</h3>
<p>E-Gov Integrated Data Collection (IDC) is a consolidated approach to reporting requirements related to OMB's Office of E-Government and IT, the Federal CIO, and the Federal IT management community. Although established through PortfolioStat 2013, the scope of IDC and this MAX page goes beyond PortfolioStat.</p>

<p>By considering a large variety of reporting requirements under IDC, OMB will both (1) simplify the requirements for agency reporting to OMB and (2) improve OMB and agency meaningful use of reported data to improve IT and strategic decision-making.</p>
