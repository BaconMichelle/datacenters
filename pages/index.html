<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) established in OMB Memorandum <a>M##-##</a> is the next step in the evolution of federal data centers following the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) launched by OMB in 2010.</p>

<p>In December 2014, the President signed into law the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) which:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Challenges federal agencies to focus on both consolidation, and optimization;</li>
    <li>Requires the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO) to provide public updates on cumulative progress, and establish and publish cost savings and optimization improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p>To meet FITARA requirements, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established the DCOI policy to help federal agencies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Develop and report on data center strategies;</li>
    <li>Transition to more efficient infrastructure, such as cloud services and inter-agency shared services;</li>
    <li>Leverage technology advancements to optimize infrastructure;</li>
    <li>Provide quality services for the public good.</li>
</ul>
