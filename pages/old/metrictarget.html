<h2 id="metric-target-values">Metric Target Values</h2>

<p>OMB will measure agency progress for this initiative using the following optimization, cost savings, and closure metrics and goals on a quarterly basis, by way of agencies' quarterly data center inventory submissions.</p>

<p>Optimization, cost-savings, and closure metrics and goals apply to all federally-owned data centers, except high-performance computing (HPC) nodes.</p>

<h3 id="goal-1-optimization">Goal 1: Optimization</h3>

<p>The following optimization metrics are listed in order of priority. Agencies shall achieve and maintain all listed target values by the end of fiscal year 2018:<sup id="fnr22"><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup></p>

<p>Only the Server Utilization &amp; Automated Monitoring optimization metric shall apply to non-tiered data centers.</p>

<h3 id="goal-2-cost-savings-and-avoidance">Goal 2: Cost Savings and Avoidance</h3>

<p>Agencies shall, by the end of fiscal year 2018, reduce government-wide annual costs attributable to physical data centers by at least 25%, relative to the fiscal year 2016 IT Infrastructure Spending data submitted to the Federal IT Dashboard. Agencies shall collectively achieve the following amounts of savings (combined cost savings and cost avoidance)<sup id="fnr28"><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup> in each of fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018:</p>

<p>Within 30 days after publication of this document, OMB OFCIO will set individual cost savings and cost avoidance goals for each agency.</p>

<h3 id="goal-3-closed-data-centers">Goal 3: Closed Data Centers</h3>

<p>In all cases, the term "closed" for data centers shall refer exclusively to tiered or non-tiered data centers that: a) no longer consume power; or b) no longer house physical servers (whether in a production, test, stage, development, or any other environment).</p>

<p>Based on the number of data centers designated by the agencies as already undergoing some part of the closure process, agencies currently plan to close 22% of tiered data centers and 50% of non-tiered, non-cloud data centers, for a total of 44% of all Federal data centers. OMB's goal for the DCOI is informed by, but exceeds, agencies' existing closure plans.</p>

<p>By the end of fiscal year 2018, agencies shall close at least 25% of tiered data centers government-wide, excluding those approved as inter-agency shared services provider data centers. Furthermore, agencies must close at least 60% of non-tiered data centers government-wide.<sup id="fnr29"><a href="#fn29">29</a></sup> This target will result in the closure of 52% of the overall Federal data center inventory and a reduction of approximately 31% <sup id="fnr30><a href=" #fn30"="">30</sup> in the gross floor area occupied by data centers, government-wide. Agencies shall prioritize the closure of data centers that are unable to meet applicable PUE optimization targets and/or pose management or security challenges due to age.</p>

<p>In the long term, all agencies should continually strive to close all non-tiered data centers. Server rooms and closets pose security risks and management challenges and are an inefficient use of resources. As such, although at least 60% of non-tiered data centers are required to be closed before the end of fiscal year 2018, OMB expects that agencies will consider all such facilities as temporary and work to close them.</p>

<p>Within 30 days after publication of this document, OMB OFCIO will share with each agency its individual goal for data centers closures, specifying the respective number of tiered and non-tiered data centers the agency must close.</p>
