## Data Center Optimization Transparency

Under FITARA,<sup id="fnr33"><a href="#fn33">33</a></sup> OMB must make publicly available agencies' progress toward the goals established herein and relative to agencies' Strategic Plans.

To this end, beginning in 2016, OMB will report on government-wide and agency-specific data center progress as part of the IT Dashboard, which will display:

* Planned and achieved data center closures by agency;
* Government-wide and agency progress toward meeting applicable optimization targets;
* Cumulative cost savings and cost avoidance realized through the implementation of the DCOI and prior initiatives;
* Annual data center investment spending per agency, including investment transition costs, cost savings projections, progress made against projections and improvements realized through the implementation of the strategy.
